# Get familiar with NLTK
1.	New a Python 3 notebook in Jupyter.2.	Test if NLTK is installed successfully: Run command “import nltk”.If there is no error, NLTK is installed successfully. Go to Step 4.If the error is like “ImportError: No module named 'nltk'”, then NLTK is not installed. Go to Step 3.3.	Install NLTK: Mac: 在终端(Terminal)中运行 “sudo pip install nltk”，输入帐户的密码，即可安装。Windows: 开始-> 所有程序-> anaconda-> anaconda prompt，可以打开anaconda 命令窗口。在anaconda 命令窗口里输入“pip install nltk”，即可安装。4.	Install NLTK resources: Run command “nltk.download()”, a window pops out as follows. Choose “all”, and click “Download”. 5.	Go through “NLTKpractice.ipynb” to test tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging, stopword deletion. 6.	Bonus: Go through “StanfordParserPractice.ipynb”. NLTK does not perform well on dependency parsing task, so StanfordParser is used more frequently. This task is optional since StanfordParser requires to install Java 1.8, which will not be used in the future course. If you finish the previous work early, it is encouraged to install Java 1.8 and do this task, since Stanford NLP tools are widely used to extract NLP features.

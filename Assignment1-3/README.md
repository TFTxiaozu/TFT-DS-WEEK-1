# Get familiar with Naïve Bayes1.	Get to know the Kaggle project [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge), it aims to identify and classify toxic online comments. Namely, given a comment, you need to predict a probability for each of the six possible types of the comment toxicity (toxic, severe\_toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity_hate).
2.	Download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data).
3.	Finish the project Toxic Comment Classification in “ToxicCommentNB.ipynb”

4. Get help from "ToxicCommentNB-Answer.ipynb" and "ToxicCommentNB-AnswerTFIDF.ipynb". "ToxicCommentNB-Answer.ipynb" uses CountVectorizer, while "ToxicCommentNB-AnswerTFIDF.ipynb" uses TFIDFVectorizer.
